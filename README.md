# Soen 499 Project

### Abstract

Our project aims to find favorable bicycle stations in the city of Montreal, according to the most traveled paths by cyclists. A favorable bicycle station is a location where bicycles can be held such that it is nearest of many points of interest in a particular area of Montreal. The dataset to produce these results will be taken from the company Bixi Montreal. Bixi provides to the public data of the paths visited by their bixi cyclists, which will be analyzed in this project. Lastly, our project will also produce a formula to calculate the “most visited” paths from a set of traveled cyclist paths.
